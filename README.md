# Codeon

Codeon is a **smart contract auditing and analysis platform** designed to help developers evaluate the **security, performance, and compliance** of their smart contracts before deployment.  

It provides:
- **Multi-language support** (Solidity, Vyper, Rust, Move, Cairo, Go, etc.).
- **Automated vulnerability scanning** and performance checks.
- **Professional PDF audit reports** with charts, severity levels, and recommendations.
- **Simple and intuitive frontend** for uploading contracts and downloading results.  

> ⚡ Codeon’s mission is to make **security and transparency** in smart contract development **accessible, automated, and developer-friendly**.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### 1. Frontend (User Interface)
- Upload contract files (`.sol`, `.vy`, `.rs`, `.move`, etc.).
- Select contract language.
- Trigger audit → display results + PDF download option.
- **Stack:** React + Tailwind CSS.

### 2. Backend (Analysis Engine)
- Handles parsing, analysis, and tests.
- Integrates with static analysis tools (Slither, Move Prover, Clippy, etc.).
- Generates JSON output of findings.
- Converts results to styled PDF.
- **Stack:** Node.js (TypeScript) or Python.

### 3. Report Engine
- Converts backend JSON → PDF with charts & branding.
- **Stack:** ReportLab (Python) or Puppeteer (Node.js).

## 🔄 User Flow
1. Developer visits Codeon web app.  
2. Uploads smart contract file.  
3. Selects programming language.  
4. Backend runs analysis.  
5. Results displayed in frontend.  
6. Developer downloads a **PDF Audit Report**.
